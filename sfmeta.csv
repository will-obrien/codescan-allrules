the description of your shared components. You can configure this rule to verify this by setting
additional property 'requireProjectNamespace' of this rule to true value.

of executing 'sfdx force:mdapi:listmetadata' properties and put it inside root of your project. In this case
the rule will also be able to verify project namespace in the shared components of your project.
