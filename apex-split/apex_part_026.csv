sf:MultiLineComment,Multi-line comments should not be empty,"An empty multi-line comment is likely to be a mistake and doesn’t help to improve the readability of the code. For these reasons, it should be removed.",MINOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:MaximumNumberOfCase,Switch statements should not have too many case clauses,Switch statements with a large number of case clauses create complex and difficult-to-read code,MAJOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:AvoidAbsoluteURL,"URLs of Salesforce pages should be relative, not absolute",Code using absolute URLs for Salesforce pages will break in different environments. Use relative URLs instead.,MAJOR,APEX,BUG,FALSE
sf:UseAreEqualInsteadOfAssertBoolean,Use Assert Equals Instead Of Boolean Equality Assertion,"This rule detects unit test assertions in object references equality. Instead of using Assert.isTrue combined with ""=="" as an equality operator, these assertions should be made by more specific methods, like Assert.areEqual(expected, actual).",MINOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:UseAreEqualInsteadOfIsTrue,Use Assert.areEqual instead of Assert.isTrue,"This rule detects Unit test assertions in object references equality. Instead of using Assert.isTrue as an equality check, these assertions should be made by more specific methods, like Assert.areEqual.",MINOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:UseIsTrueInsteadOfAreEqual,Use Assert.isTrue instead of Assert.areEqual,"When asserting a value is the same as a boolean literal, use Assert.isTrue, instead of Assert.areEqual.",MINOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:SystemRunAs,Use System.runAs to test user permissions,"To ensure accurate and realistic testing of user permissions, it is crucial to utilize System.runAs during test execution. This ensures that logic is tested in the same context it will run in.",MAJOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:NullCoalescingOperator,Use the null coalescing operator instead of the ternary operator,Consider replacing ternary operators (? :) for explicit null checks with the Null Coalescing operator (??) where applicable to enhance code performance and clarity.,MINOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:IfElseDefaultCase,“If ... else if” should have “else” case,"Including a default case using an ""else"" statement at the end of ""if"" and ""else if"" clauses to handle all conditions and provide clarity in code.",CRITICAL,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
sf:CommentHardcodedValues,Comment All Hardcoded Values,"Ensure that any hardcoded values or strings in the code are accompanied by descriptive comments or, alternatively, use constants. This practice enhances code readability, maintainability, and will make it easier for other developers to understand the purpose of these values.",MINOR,APEX,CODE_SMELL,FALSE
