AddEmptyString - XPath is looking for double quotes which don't parse in APEX.  
    XPath should be //AdditiveExpression/PrimaryExpression/PrimaryPrefix/Literal[@Image="''"]
    Fix the test so the example fails

AvoidInsecureMessageDigests - Doesn't find when the crypto.generateDigest is assigned

AvoidReversedOperators - Is a sack of garbage.  Doesn't even pick up our own example.

AvoidSOQLInControllerGetterTrigger - Clead up the tests.  Good tests have Bad written in them??

CouplingBetweenObjects - Tests are garbage.



Fixing?

BrokenNullCheck
AvoidLogicInTrigger
ControllerNaming
